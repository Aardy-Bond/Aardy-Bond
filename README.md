# Storacha Skeleton Vault ðŸŽƒ

Storacha Skeleton Vault is a decentralized file storage application built for the **Storacha Halloween Hackathon 2024**. The project leverages **Storacha's blazing-fast decentralized storage** and **Ethereum Sepolia testnet** for secure, verifiable access control. Inspired by the Halloween theme, the spooky-themed interface allows users to upload their "skeletons" (files) securely into decentralized storage, accessible only through proper permissions granted via Ethereum smart contracts.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored securely using Storachaâ€™s Web3 storage network.
- **Access Control via Smart Contract**: The Ethereum Sepolia testnet manages permissions, ensuring only authorized users can upload files.
- **Halloween-Themed UI**: A spooky interface with animations and a creepy design to match the Halloween spirit.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Connects to MetaMask for wallet authentication and transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for the user interface.
- **Node.js and Express**: Backend server for delegation and storage requests.
- **Web3 Storage (Storacha)**: Decentralized storage solution.
- **Ethereum Smart Contract**: Access control on the Sepolia testnet.
- **MetaMask**: For user wallet authentication and blockchain interactions.
- **Ethers.js**: Library for interacting with Ethereum and Sepolia networks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **pnpm** package manager.
- **MetaMask** browser extension (connected to Sepolia testnet).
- **Ethereum Sepolia Test ETH** for test transactions (obtainable from a Sepolia faucet).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/storacha-skeleton-vault.git
   cd storacha-skeleton-vault
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     pnpm install
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     pnpm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   In the `backend/.env` file, add your MetaMask private key and Infura project ID:
   ```plaintext
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your_MetaMask_Private_Key>
   INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<Your_Infura_Project_ID>
   ```

4. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   - Deploy `AccessControl.sol` to Sepolia using Remix or Hardhat.
   - Copy the deployed contract address and ABI for frontend integration.

5. **Start the Application**:
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     pnpm start
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     pnpm start
     ```

6. **Configure MetaMask**:
   - Ensure MetaMask is connected to Sepolia testnet.
   - Fund MetaMask with Sepolia ETH from a faucet if necessary.

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click **Connect MetaMask** in the frontend.
2. **Request Access**: If not already authorized, request access by interacting with the smart contract. MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction.
3. **Upload File**: After authorization, select a file and click **Upload to Storacha**.
4. **Transaction Fees**: Transactions on Sepolia are covered by test ETH from MetaMask.

## Troubleshooting

1. **"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'currentSpace')"**:
   - Ensure `currentSpace` is correctly initialized in `delegationService.js`.
   - Check for console logs indicating issues during space creation or retrieval.

2. **"Failed to upload" Error**:
   - Confirm that the `w3up-client` is configured correctly and initialized in `delegationService.js`.
   - Verify the contract is deployed and the address is correct in `App.js`.

3. **Address Already in Use**:
   - If you see an error indicating port 3000 is in use, kill the existing process or change the port in `server.js`.

4. **MetaMask Network Issues**:
   - Ensure MetaMask is set to Sepolia.
   - Use the `wallet_switchEthereumChain` method in the frontend code to prompt users to switch networks if needed.

## Future Enhancements

- **Add Multi-User Access Control**: Enable file upload permissions for multiple users.
- **Implement File Encryption**: Add an encryption layer to enhance data security.
- **Automated Testing**: Add tests for smart contract interactions and frontend functions.
- **Expand Theme Options**: Provide more themes for different holidays or events.
